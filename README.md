# LINEMOD toolkits

## Introduction

This repository contains tools to create a LINEMOD format dataset on customized items. The dataset can be used with various 6D object pose estimation projects such as singleshotpose. Ideally, if you have realsense cameras and have some experience with MeshLab or Blender, creating your customized dataset should be as easy as executing a few command line arguments.

This codes in this repository implement a raw 3D model acquisition pipeline through aruco markers and ICP registration. The raw 3D model obtained needs to be processed and noise-removed in a mesh processing software. After this step, there are functions to generate required labels in the LINEMOD style automatically. 

The codes are currently written for a single object of interest per frame. They can be modified to create a dataset that has several items within a frame.

## Installation

The installation has been tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 2.7

### Step 1:

Upgrading any pre-install packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
### Step 2:

Install pip, a Python package manager, and update

```bash
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo -H pip2 install --upgrade pip
```
### Step 3:

Install the required packages through apt-get

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libssl-dev
```

### Step 4:

Install the required packages through pip

```bash
sudo pip install numpy Cython==0.19 pypng scipy scikit-learn open3d-python scikit-image open3d-python tqdm pykdtree opencv-python==3.3.0.10 opencv-contrib-python==3.3.0.10  trimesh==2.3.12
```
Note: the code was written for opencv ver > 3.0.0 and ver < 3.4.3, so the code should work out of the box if you install opencv anew as instructed. However, if you have already installed opencv, the code
may need adjustment since different versions of opencv have slightly different API

### Step 5 (Optional):

Install librealsense and pyrealsense wrapper (if you are using realsense camera F200, SR300)

Note: If you do not need to use python wrapper for the driver, please install the latest SDK which is easy to install, the python wrapper only supports the legacy version, which is not supported anymore, and its installation manual is wrong.

(IMPORTANT): Check your kernel version and make sure you have 4.4 by running:

```bash
uname -r
```

If you install 16.04 recently, your kernel version is most likely higher than 4.4, (e.g., 4.8, 4.10, 4.15). In this case, you do not necessarily need to downgrade your kernel version as 4.4 is still supported on 16.04.

If you do not know how to boot into the 4.4 kernel, you need to access grub and boot into 4.4 using the following step:

```bash
sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic
sudo nano /etc/default/grub && sudo update-grub
```

Comment out GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and GRUB_TIMEOUT=0, write the file Ctrl+o and exit Ctrl+x, update-grub will then run. After update-grub, the grub menu should not be hidden when rebooting.

Reboot your computer, go to advanced options, and boot the version starting with 4.4.

Note: make sure you boot with this kernel version when you install the driver and use the camera in the future.

Install librealsense

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
git checkout v1.12.1
```

Make sure that the depth camera is unplugged, and follow the installation steps in
(https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/v1.12.1/doc/installation.md)

#### NOTE

When you run ./scripts/patch-uvcvideo-16.04.simple.sh, you will get this error: /bin/bash: ./scripts/ubuntu-retpoline-extract-one: No such file or directory

There is no precaution for this, and you need to wait until this error appears to fix this by:

```bash
cd ubuntu-xenial
cp debian/scripts/retpoline-extract-one scripts/ubuntu-retpoline-extract-one
```

And then rerun ./scripts/patch-uvcvideo-16.04.simple.sh (press y when ask if re-apply patch again)

You will also get other errors if you didnâ€™t follow the preparation step. After the errors have been fixed, resume with the remaining steps provided by librealsense.

Install pyrealsense driver

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toinsson/pyrealsense
cd pyrealsense
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Create dataset on customized items

1. Color print the pdf with the correctly sized aruco markers in the arucomarkers folder. Affix the markers surrounding the object of interest as shown in the picture.
![BackFlow](doc/1.jpg)

2. Record an object sequence, record.py records an object video sequence after a countdown of 5 seconds for 40 seconds, you can change the recording interval or exit the recording by pressing "q". Please steadily move the camera to get different views of the object while maintaining that 2-3 markers are within the field of view of the camera at any time. 

Assume the object being recorded is a sugar box.

```python
python record.py LINEMOD/sugar
```

Note that the project assumes all sequences are saved under the folder named "LINEMOD", use other folder names will cause an error. 

If you are using a realsense camera, color images, depth aligned to color images, and camera parameters will be automatically saved under the directory of the sequence. If you are using other cameras, please put color images in JPEGImages folder and the aligned depth images in the depth folder. 

If you don't know your camera's intrinsic, you can put a rough estimate in. All parameters required are fx, fy, cx, cy, where commonly fx = fy and equals to the width of the image and cx and cy is the center of the image. For example, for a 640 x 480 resolution image, fx, fy = 480, cx = 320, cy = 240. 

3.  Compute transforms for all frames at the specified interval (interval can be changed in config/registrationParameters) against the first frame, save the transforms(4*4 homogenous transforms) as an numpy array (.npy).

```python
python compute_gt_poses.py LINEMOD/sugar
```

4.  Register all frames and create mesh for the registered scene.

```python
python register_scene.py LINEMOD/sugar
```
A raw registeredScene.ply will be saved under the specified directory (e.g., LINEMOD/sugar). The registeredScene.ply is a reconstruction of the scene that includes the table top, markers, and any other objects exposed during the scanning, with some level of noise removal. The generated mesh looks something like this:

![BackFlow](doc/unsegmented.png)

Alternatively, if you want to save some effort removing all the unwanted background, you can try creating the mesh with register_segmented instead of register_scene.

```python
python register_segmented.py LINEMOD/sugar
```

Register_segmented should be able to automatically removes all the unwanted background. However, this script currently uses some ad hoc methods for segmenting the background, therefore you may need to tune some parameters for it to work with your object. The most important knob to tune is "MAX_RADIUS", which cuts off any depth reading whose euclidean distance to the center of the aruco markers observed is longer than the value specified. This value is currently set at 0.2 m , if you have a larger object, you may need to increase this value to not cut off parts of your object. Result from running register_segmented looks something like this:

![BackFlow](doc/segmented.png)

5. Process the mesh

The mesh needs to be processed to 1) remove noises that are not the object of interest. 2) to complete the missing side.

An video instruction is posted in [here] (https://youtu.be/BPX-j9xE2EQ)

Recent 6D pose estimation projects such as singleshotpose use mesh geometries purely for evaluation purpose and the texture information is not needed. Therefore, it's acceptable to "close holes" as shown in the video for planar areas. Also, for symmetrical objects, complete the shape manually by symmetry.

Make sure that the processed mesh is free of ANY isolated noise, and is NOT saved as a binary format (Basically, you should follow the video closely).

6. Create label files

When you have completed step 1-4 for all customized objects, run

```python
python create_label_files.py all
```
or 

```python
python create_label_files.py LINEMOD/sugar
```

This step creates labels in the format singleshotpose requires as well as masks for all color images. It also creates new mesh files (e.g., sugar.ply) whose AABBs are centered at the origin and are the same dimensions as the OBB. Open those new mesh files in meshlab and save them again by unchecking the binary format option. Those files are used by singleshotpose for evaluation and pose estimation purpose, and singleshotpose cannot read mesh that is binary encoded.

Currently, class labels are assigned in a hacky way (e.g., by the order the folder is grabbed among all sequence folders), if you call create_label for each folder they will be assigned the same label, so please read the printout and change class label manually in create_label_files.py.



## (Optional) Create additional files required by singleshotpose

1. Create train and test image directories

```python
python makeTrainTestfiles.py
```

2. Complete the path file

For each of the customized object, create an objectname.data file in the cfg folder

To get the object scale(max vertice distance), you can run

```python
python getmeshscale.py
```

This should be everything you need, please don't forget to update the camera calibration parameters in singleshotpose as well.
